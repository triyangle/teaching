1) What's something related to teaching in which you think you've improved since the beginning of the semester?
I think I've improved with regards to teaching in that I now have more experience interacting with different kinds of students, and as a result I have a better sense of how to best approach and interact with new students moving forward.

2) What's an area that you'd like to improve further in your burgeoning teaching practice?
One area I'd like to improve on is coming up with questions and problems for students to solve. I feel like well-written problems are able to help students better grasp the material at a more intuitive level and I don't feel like I'm quite at that level of coming with questions/problems yet.
